The leaflet has more pages than possible, each and every one of them getting more and more chaotic and giving you a splitting headache as the fabric of reality seems to collapse around your vision. Suddenly, it's all clear to you. On the final page, you read a complex formula on how to summon a shoggoth, seemingly written in your handwriting.",
